# VegetationCCI
Contains tools and scrips for using the datasets produced in the ESA CCI vegetation project

We (VITO, FASTOPT, HYGEOS, EOLAB, the Universties of Twente, Antwerp and University College London) produce, validate and use climatological time series of essential climate variables (ECV's) of leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of photosynthetically active solar radiation absrorbed by vegetation (fPAR). We also provide additional data products of added value, such as leaf chlorophyll content and the absorption of PAR by chlorophyll (fPAR_Chl), and in the near future we will introduce products derived from solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF).

In this repository you will find files with instructions on how to use the data further

- The notebook 'esacci.ipyenb' contains instructions and an example for accessing, downloading and visualizing vegetation data (dataset 'CRDP 1' of the ESA's Vegetation CCI+ project.
- The notebook 'ecacci.ipyenb' contains instructures an an example to extract time series for a point of interest fromt he tiles provided in the dataset.
